 # Project Title: Weather App

Project Description:

In this project, you will develop a weather app using Kivy in Python that allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecast for a specific location. The app will have the following features:

User Interface: The user interface will be designed using Kivy and will include a search bar, a weather icon, temperature, and a brief description of the current weather conditions.

Location Search: Users will be able to enter the name of a city, state, or country to get weather information for that location.

Weather Information: The app will use an API to fetch weather information for the selected location, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecast for the next few days.

Unit Conversion: Users will be able to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measurement for the temperature display.

Data Persistence: The app will use a local database to store the user's favorite locations so that they can quickly access weather information for those locations.

Tools and Technologies:

Python 3
Kivy (for the GUI)
OpenWeatherMap API (for the weather information)
SQLite (for the database)
Project Steps:

Design the user interface using Kivy. The UI should include a search bar, a weather icon, temperature, and a brief description of the current weather conditions.

Implement location search using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather information for the selected location.

Create a database schema for storing favorite locations.

Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing favorite locations.

Implement unit conversion feature to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units of measurement.

Test the application thoroughly and fix any bugs that you find.

Finally, package the application into a standalone executable using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze so that users can run it on their systems without having to install any dependencies.
